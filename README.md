# Real-time parking lot occupancy detection using Deep Learning

This repo has source code and model files for the implementation of "Real-time image-based parking occupancy detection using deep learning", Acharya, D., Yan, W., &amp; Khoshelham, K. 2018 work.

The author implemented the model using pre-trained VGG network and Support Vector Machines. The model is trained on PKLot dataset and evaluated on custom dataset created by authors.
